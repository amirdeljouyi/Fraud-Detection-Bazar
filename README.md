# Detecting Fraud On Divar Using Machine Learning
To detect fraud on divar dataset, first of all, we need to labeling dataset unsupervised by clustering and find farthest points for each cluster, secondly use classification algorithm for prediction
## Steps:
1. Preproccessing
2. Normalize Data
3. Clustering
   * Find Best Number of Cluster
4. Decomposition PCA
5. Classification
6. Calculate Precision and Recall
